# About business partnerships

After two failed businesses and one ([BIBB](https://www.bibb.pro/)) that has yet to fully find its shape, I’ve come to believe that among the many challenges of building a venture, choosing the right business partner is the hardest step. It’s not just about skillsets—it’s also about trust, direction, and personal alignment. 

I write this as Diana, my cofounder and business partner at BIBB, has decided to step away to focus on herself and other projects. Her decision hurt, but I understand her reasons. She needs to follow her own path, and no one can argue. 

Diana brought the UX to *UX Driven BI*: her expertise guided BIBB’s evolution from an online store to a platform for uploading CVs and eventually to a blog showcasing one of the [most popular tools for Power BI](https://powerbithemegenerator.bibb.pro/). 

She also created the visual identity and cohesive style that BIBB users experience—something I will always appreciate. Her commitment to user-friendly, ethical design means our site has no dark patterns or intrusive advertisements, giving it a distinct, polished feel. Her contributions were essential to the journey.

I’m truly grateful she chose to be part of BIBB for these years, and I wish her every success in whatever she decides to do next. 

For now, I’m reflecting on whether to keep going solo or seek a new partner. I won’t rush that decision, though. My immediate focus is on preparing for a presentation at the [Association of Proposal Management Professionals](https://www.apmp.org/). 

There’s a lot to do on that front, and I want to give it my full attention before making any major changes at BIBB.
